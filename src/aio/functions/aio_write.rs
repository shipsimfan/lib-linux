    /// `nbytes` of the structure pointed to by `aiocbp`.
    ///
    /// If [`O_APPEND`] is not set, the data is written starting at the absolute position
    /// `aiocbp.offset`, regardless of the file offset. If [`O_APPEND`] is set, data is written at
    /// the end of the file in the same order as [`aio_write`] calls are made. After the call, the
    /// value of the file offset is unspecified.
    ///

    /// the write may or may not have completed when the call returns. One tests for completion
    /// using [`aio_error`]. The return status of a completed I/O operation can be obtained

    /// On success, 0 is returned. On error, the request is not enqueued, -1 is returned, and
    /// [`errno`] is set to indicate the error. If an error is detected only later, it will be
    /// reported via [`aio_return`] (returns status -1) and [`aio_error`] (error statusâ€”whatever
    /// one would have gotten in [`errno`], such as [`EBADF`]).

    /// # Errors
    ///  * [`EAGAIN`] - Out of resources.
    ///  * [`EBADF`] - `fildes` is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.
    ///  * [`EFBIG`] - The file is a regular file, we want to write at least one byte, but the
    ///                starting position is at or beyond the maximum offset for this file.
    ///  * [`EINVAL`] - One or more of `offset`, `reqprio`, `nbytes` are invalid.
    ///  * [`ENOSYS`] - [`aio_write`] is not implemented.
