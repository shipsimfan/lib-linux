    /// Reposition read/write file offset
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// The [`lseek`] function repositions the offset of the open file associated with the file
    /// descriptor `fd` to the argument `offset` according to the directive `whence` as follows:
    ///  * [`SEEK_SET`] - The offset is set to `offset` bytes.
    ///  * [`SEEK_CUR`] - The offset is set to its current location plus `offset` bytes.
    ///  * [`SEEK_END`] - The offset is set to the size of the file plus `offset` bytes.
    ///
    /// Since version 3.1, Linux supports the following additional values for `whence`:
    ///  * [`SEEK_DATA`] - Adjust the file offset to the next location in the file greater than or
    ///                    equal to `offset` containing data. If `offset` points to data, then the
    ///                    file offset is set to `offset`.
    ///  * [`SEEK_HOLE`] - Adjust the file offset to the next hole in the file greater than or
    ///                    equal to `offset`. If `offset` points into the middle of a hole, then
    ///                    the file offset is set to `offset`. If there is no hole past `offset`,
    ///                    then the file offset is adjusted to the end of the file (i.e., there is
    ///                    an implicit hole at the end of any file).
    ///
    /// In both of the above cases, [`lseek`] fails if `offset` points past the end of the file.
    ///
    /// These operations allow applications to map holes in a sparsely allocated file. This can be
    /// useful for applications such as file backup tools, which can save space when creating
    /// backups and preserve holes, if they have a mechanism for discovering holes.
    ///
    /// For the purposes of these operations, a hole is a sequence of zeros that (normally) has not
    /// been allocated in the underlying file storage. However, a file system is not obliged to
    /// report holes, so these operations are not a guaranteed mechanism for mapping the storage
    /// space actually allocated to a file. (Furthermore, a sequence of zeros that actually has
    /// been written to the underlying storage may not be reported as a hole.) In the simplest
    /// implementation, a file system can support the operations by making [`SEEK_HOLE`] always
    /// return the offset of the end of the file, and making [`SEEK_DATA`] always return `offset`
    /// (i.e., even if the location referred to by offset is a hole, it can be considered to
    /// consist of data that is a sequence of zeros).
    ///
    /// The [`lseek`] function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the file (but
    /// this does not change the size of the file). If data is later written at this point,
    /// subsequent reads of the data in the gap (a "hole") return null bytes (aq\0aq) until data is
    /// actually written into the gap.
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// Upon successful completion, [`lseek`] returns the resulting offset location as measured in
    /// bytes from the beginning of the file. On error, the value `-1 as off_t` is returned and
    /// [`errno`] is set to indicate the error.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///  * [`EBADF`] - `fd` is not an open file descriptor.
    ///  * [`EINVAL`] - `whence` is not valid. Or: the resulting file offset would be negative, or
    ///                 beyond the end of a seekable device.
    ///  * [`EOVERFLOW`] - The resulting file offset cannot be represented in an [`off_t`].
    ///  * [`ESPIPE`] - `fd` is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.
    ///  * [`ENXIO`] - `whence` is [`SEEK_DATA`] or [`SEEK_HOLE`], and the current file offset is
    ///                beyond the end of the file.
